__Why doesn't Lineman use Bower or any other Package Management tools?__

For the same reason Lineman doesn't care to know which front-end JavaScript framework you choose to build your application with: if you ask a hundred front-end developers how it ought to work, you'll get a hundred different answers. Even developers who agree on a tool tend to arrive with different expectations at where to draw the boundaries between automation and convention. A bunch of questions arise, and the answer to each will narrow Lineman's audience; questions like: should we limit our dependency management to fetching libs? Should we include a module requirement mechanism? Should we encourage asynchronous script loading? Should that be configured or declarative?

There's simply way too much variety and churn in this space to pick a path and be confident that it'll have been the right decision multiple years from now (in fact, our money is that none of the current approaches will mature into the eventual browser-supported standard in a forward-compatible way). I've written about this topic at length and why I view it as a concern that's not critical enough to concern myself with yet at [our blog](http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2013-06-16-unrequired-love.html)
