__Why does Lineman use Testem as its default test runner?__

We like Testem because Lineman & Testem seem to share a core motivation: *make development a delightful, joyful activity*, a priority that's been sorely lacking from front-end web development up until very recently. Testem was incredibly easy to integrate into our default Lineman configuration, supports a variety of test library adapters and usage patterns for the benefit of users, and is otherwise unopinionated and unbiased.

It does what it says on the tin, and not a thing more.

It could be argued that it's not the only test runner in Node-land to do so, but we've yet to see it argued that anything else is objectively better.
