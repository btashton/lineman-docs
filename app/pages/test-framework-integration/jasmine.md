Lineman is preconfigured to use [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine). Lineman also ships with a few Jasmine helpers:

 - [jasmine-fixture](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture): inject DOM fixtures with a CSS-selector-style syntax
 - [jasmine-given](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-given): given/when/then DSL for Jasmine specs
 - [jasmine-only](https://github.com/davemo/jasmine-only): run only the spec(s) you want
 - [jasmine-stealth](https://github.com/searls/jasmine-stealth): adds a little sugar to Jasmine spies

They are located in `spec/helpers/`, along with `helper.js` (which just adds some helpful aliases).
