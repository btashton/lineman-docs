Lineman uses the great [Testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) runner, which means Lineman can be configured to use any test framework that Testem can!

Configure Testem in `config/spec.json` (refer to Testem's [config file documentation](https://github.com/airportyh/testem#configuration-file))
